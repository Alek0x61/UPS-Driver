# UPS Driver For Estimating The Remaining Charge 

### Description

I tested it on UPS Hat for Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W created by Waveshare [Waveshare UPS HAT](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/UPS_HAT_(C))
As the title suggests, this is a driver used to estimate the remaining battery charge as a percentage. 
I wrote it with the help of example Python code provided by Waveshare in their documentation for the UPS HAT.
